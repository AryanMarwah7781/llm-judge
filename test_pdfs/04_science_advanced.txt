Q: Explain the Chevron deference doctrine
A: Chevron deference, established in Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), is a principle of administrative law requiring federal courts to defer to administrative agencies' reasonable interpretations of ambiguous statutes they administer. The doctrine applies a two-step framework: First, courts determine whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue; if the statute is silent or ambiguous, courts move to step two and defer to the agency's interpretation if it is reasonable. This doctrine reflects the principle that agencies possess superior expertise in their regulatory domains and that Congress implicitly delegates interpretive authority to agencies when it leaves statutory language ambiguous. However, the doctrine has faced increasing scrutiny and criticism in recent years.

Q: What is the exclusionary rule?
A: The exclusionary rule is a legal principle that prohibits the use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials. Established by the Supreme Court in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961), the rule serves as a deterrent against unconstitutional police conduct, particularly violations of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures. The rationale is that excluding tainted evidence discourages law enforcement from violating constitutional rights. The rule has several exceptions, including the good-faith exception (when officers reasonably rely on a defective warrant), the inevitable discovery doctrine (when evidence would have been found through lawful means), and the attenuation doctrine (when the connection between the illegal conduct and the evidence is sufficiently attenuated). Critics argue the rule lets guilty defendants go free on technicalities, while supporters contend it is essential for protecting constitutional rights.

Q: Describe the Dormant Commerce Clause doctrine
A: The Dormant Commerce Clause is a doctrine inferred from the Commerce Clause of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress power to regulate interstate commerce. Even when Congress has not exercised this power, the doctrine prohibits states from enacting legislation that unduly burdens or discriminates against interstate commerce. The Supreme Court has developed a framework for analyzing such laws: facially discriminatory laws (those that explicitly favor in-state over out-of-state interests) are subject to strict scrutiny and nearly always struck down unless the state proves the law serves a legitimate local purpose that cannot be served by reasonable nondiscriminatory alternatives. Facially neutral laws that burden interstate commerce are evaluated under the balancing test from Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970), which asks whether the burden on commerce is clearly excessive in relation to putative local benefits. This doctrine ensures a national common market by preventing protectionist state legislation while respecting federalism principles.
