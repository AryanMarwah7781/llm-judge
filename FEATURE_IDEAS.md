# Feature Ideas for LLM Judge Platform

Based on your current app and what would actually be useful for users.

---

## PRIORITY 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days each)

These add immediate value with minimal effort.

### 1. ‚úÖ Lightweight Safety Checks (Option C)
**What:** Add fast bias/adversarial detection before evaluation
**Time:** 1-2 days
**Value:** Catch obvious problems without performance hit

**Implementation:**
```python
# In app/routers/evaluate.py
from app.services.adversarial.jailbreak_detector import JailbreakDetector
from app.services.adversarial.bias_tester import BiasTester

async def evaluate(...):
    # Quick safety check (50-100ms overhead)
    detector = JailbreakDetector()
    bias_tester = BiasTester()

    # Check each Q&A pair
    warnings = []
    for qa in qa_pairs:
        manipulation = await detector.detect_manipulation(qa.question, qa.answer)
        if manipulation['is_manipulative']:
            warnings.append({
                "qa_index": i,
                "type": "manipulation",
                "score": manipulation['manipulation_score']
            })

        bias = bias_tester.test_for_bias(qa.answer)
        if bias['has_bias'] and bias['overall_score'] > 0.7:
            warnings.append({
                "qa_index": i,
                "type": "bias",
                "categories": bias['categories_affected']
            })

    # Return warnings alongside normal results
    return {
        "results": results,
        "safety_warnings": warnings  # New field
    }
```

**Frontend addition:**
- Show warning badges on Q&A pairs with issues
- Color-code results (green=clean, yellow=warnings, red=blocked)
- Optional "Show Details" for what was detected

## Feature Prioritization Framework

Ask yourself for each feature:

1. **Does it solve a real user problem?** (Not just cool tech)
2. **Can I build it in <3 days?** (Quick wins first)
3. **Will users actually use it?** (Be honest)
4. **Does it differentiate from competitors?** (Unique value)
5. **Can I demo it to Anthropic?** (Portfolio value)

If 3+ are "yes" ‚Üí HIGH PRIORITY
If 2 are "yes" ‚Üí MEDIUM PRIORITY
If <2 are "yes" ‚Üí SKIP FOR NOW

---

## What NOT to Build

Things that sound cool but aren't worth it:

- ‚ùå **Real-time collaborative editing** - Overengineered
- ‚ùå **AI chatbot for support** - You don't have enough users yet
- ‚ùå **Blockchain verification** - Unnecessary complexity
- ‚ùå **Custom LLM training** - Way too expensive
- ‚ùå **Video evaluations** - Different product entirely
- ‚ùå **Gamification** - Wrong use case

Focus on core evaluation features, not shiny extras.

---

## Metrics to Track

As you add features, measure:

1. **Usage:** Which features are actually used?
2. **Time saved:** Do features make users faster?
3. **Retention:** Do users come back?
4. **Conversion:** Free ‚Üí paid (if you monetize)
5. **API cost:** Are features worth the API spend?

Don't build features nobody uses!

---

## Summary

**Start with:** Top 5 recommendations (4-5 days)
**Then add:** 2-3 from Priority 2 based on feedback
**Long term:** Pick 1-2 game changers from Priority 4

This gives you a polished, differentiated product that users will love and Anthropic will be impressed by.

Want me to implement any of these? I'd start with the lightweight safety checks (Option C) since you already said that sounds good!
