Q: What is the Fair Use doctrine in copyright law?
A: Fair use is a legal doctrine, codified in 17 U.S.C. § 107, that permits limited use of copyrighted material without obtaining permission from the copyright holder. It serves as an exception to copyright protection, balancing the rights of copyright owners with the public interest in free expression and access to information. Courts analyze four statutory factors: (1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether it is commercial or for nonprofit educational purposes; (2) the nature of the copyrighted work; (3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the whole; and (4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. Transformative uses that add new expression or meaning are more likely to be considered fair use. Common applications include criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and parody.

Q: What is subject matter jurisdiction?
A: Subject matter jurisdiction is the authority of a court to hear and decide a particular type of case. Unlike personal jurisdiction (authority over the parties), subject matter jurisdiction relates to the court's power over the nature of the case itself and cannot be waived by the parties. Federal courts have limited subject matter jurisdiction, deriving their authority from Article III of the Constitution and federal statutes. The two primary bases for federal jurisdiction are federal question jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1331) for cases arising under federal law, and diversity jurisdiction (28 U.S.C. § 1332) for cases between citizens of different states involving amounts exceeding $75,000. State courts are generally courts of general jurisdiction and can hear most types of cases unless exclusive jurisdiction is granted to federal courts.

Q: Explain the doctrine of promissory estoppel
A: Promissory estoppel is an equitable doctrine that allows enforcement of promises even in the absence of a traditional contract. Codified in Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90, it prevents a promisor from denying a promise when the promisee has reasonably and detrimentally relied on that promise. The elements are: (1) a clear and definite promise; (2) the promisor should reasonably expect the promise to induce action or forbearance; (3) the promise actually induces such action or forbearance; and (4) injustice can be avoided only by enforcing the promise. Relief may be limited to prevent injustice. This doctrine fills a gap in contract law by protecting reliance interests even when consideration is absent, commonly arising in charitable subscription cases, employment situations, and family promises.

Q: What is the rule against perpetuities?
A: The rule against perpetuities is an ancient common law rule designed to prevent property interests from being tied up indefinitely in future generations. The traditional formulation provides that "no interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, not later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest." This rule prevents indefinite restraints on property alienability by requiring that property interests must vest within the relevant time period. Modern reforms have modified the harsh "all or nothing" approach through statutes like the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities (USRAP), which provides a 90-year wait-and-see period, and some states have abolished the rule entirely for certain trusts. The rule primarily affects trusts, wills, and other estate planning instruments.

Q: What is the difference between void and voidable contracts?
A: A void contract is one that is invalid from its inception and has no legal effect—it is as if no contract ever existed. Void contracts cannot be enforced by either party and include contracts for illegal purposes, contracts with impossible subject matter, and contracts made by parties with no legal capacity (such as minors in some contexts). A voidable contract, by contrast, is valid and enforceable unless one party elects to avoid it. Grounds for avoidance include fraud, duress, undue influence, mistake, lack of capacity (such as contracts by minors or incapacitated persons), and unconscionability. The key distinction is that voidable contracts give the disadvantaged party the option to affirm or rescind the contract, while void contracts are nullities from the outset. Until avoided, voidable contracts create legal obligations.
