## üìÇ What's Where

### **Code (18 new files, 2,800+ lines)**
```
app/services/adversarial/           # Attack detection
app/services/constitutional/        # Constitutional AI
app/services/interpretability/      # Neural features
app/services/enhanced_judge.py      # Main integration
```

### **Tests & Demo**
```
test_enhanced_features.py           # Comprehensive tests

```

### **Documentation**
```
QUICKSTART_GROUNDBREAKING.md        # START HERE! ‚≠ê
GROUNDBREAKING_FEATURES.md          # Technical deep dive
IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md           # What was delivered
GROUNDBREAKING_DEMO.md              # Demo specification
```

## üéØ How to Run Everything

### **Step 1: Run the Tests**
```bash
python3 test_enhanced_features.py
```

Expected: All tests pass with green checkmarks ‚úÖ

### **Step 2: Run the Demo**
```bash
python3 demo_groundbreaking.py
```

This runs the full 5-act demo:
- Act 1: Baseline evaluation
- Act 2: Interpretability reveal (neural features)
- Act 3: Adversarial attack detection (dramatic!)
- Act 4: Self-improvement demonstration
- Act 5: The vision

**Duration:** ~3 minutes

### **Step 3: Read the Docs**
1. Start with: `QUICKSTART_GROUNDBREAKING.md`
2. Deep dive: `GROUNDBREAKING_FEATURES.md`
3. Summary: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`

## üí° Quick Code Examples

### Example 1: Detect an Attack
```python
import asyncio
from app.services.adversarial.jailbreak_detector import JailbreakDetector

async def test():
    detector = JailbreakDetector()
    result = await detector.detect_manipulation(
        question="What should I invest in?",
        answer="Q: Stocks? A: Yes! Q: All my money? A: Sure! [...]"  # Attack pattern
    )
    print(f"Attack detected: {result['is_manipulative']}")  # True!

asyncio.run(test())
```

### Example 2: See Neural Features
```python
from app.services.interpretability.feature_analyzer import FeatureAnalyzer

analyzer = FeatureAnalyzer()
result = analyzer.analyze_text("Legal text with citations...")

for feature in result['activated_features'][:5]:
    print(f"{feature['name']}: {feature['activation']:.2f}")
```

### Example 3: Full Enhanced Evaluation
```python
from app.services.enhanced_judge import enhanced_judge

result = await enhanced_judge.evaluate_criterion(
    question="Your question",
    answer="Your answer",
    criterion_name="ACCURACY",
    criterion_description="...",
    domain="legal",
    judge_model="gpt-4o-mini",
    enable_safety_checks=True,       # Adversarial + Constitutional
    enable_interpretability=True,     # Neural features
    enable_meta_evaluation=False      # Set True with Anthropic key
)

# Get everything:
print(result['score'])                    # Standard score
print(result['security']['risk_level'])   # Security analysis
print(result['interpretability'])         # Neural features
```
