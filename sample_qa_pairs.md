## Q&A Set 1: Legal Domain

Q: What is the statute of limitations for filing a personal injury claim in California?

A: In California, the statute of limitations for filing a personal injury claim is generally two years from the date of the injury, as specified in California Code of Civil Procedure Section 335.1. However, there are important exceptions to this rule. If the injury was not discovered immediately (known as the "discovery rule"), the clock may start from the date the injury was discovered or reasonably should have been discovered. For injuries to minors, the statute is tolled until they reach 18 years of age. Additionally, claims against government entities have a shorter deadline - typically six months to file an administrative claim under the California Tort Claims Act. It's crucial to consult with an attorney promptly as missing these deadlines can result in losing the right to pursue compensation.

Q: What are the key elements required to prove negligence in a tort case?

A: To establish negligence in a tort case, a plaintiff must prove four essential elements: (1) Duty - the defendant owed a legal duty of care to the plaintiff; (2) Breach - the defendant breached that duty through action or inaction; (3) Causation - the defendant's breach was the actual and proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries; and (4) Damages - the plaintiff suffered actual harm or damages as a result. Each element must be proven by a preponderance of the evidence. For example, a driver has a duty to operate their vehicle safely, and if they breach this duty by running a red light, causing an accident that injures another person, all four elements may be satisfied. Courts may also consider comparative negligence, where damages are reduced if the plaintiff shares fault for their injuries.

Q: Can an employer terminate an at-will employee for any reason?

A: While at-will employment generally allows employers to terminate employees for any reason or no reason at all, there are significant legal limitations. Employers cannot terminate employees for discriminatory reasons based on protected characteristics such as race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age (40+), disability, or genetic information under federal laws like Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and the ADA. Additionally, termination cannot be in retaliation for engaging in protected activities such as whistleblowing, filing workers' compensation claims, or taking protected leave under FMLA. Many states also recognize public policy exceptions preventing termination for refusing to commit illegal acts or exercising statutory rights. Furthermore, written employment contracts, collective bargaining agreements, or employee handbooks may limit at-will employment and require just cause for termination. Employers should document legitimate business reasons for terminations and ensure consistency in application of policies to avoid wrongful termination claims.

## Q&A Set 2: Medical Domain

Q: What are the primary symptoms and treatment options for Type 2 diabetes?

A: Type 2 diabetes is characterized by several primary symptoms including increased thirst and frequent urination, increased hunger, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and frequent infections. Many people with Type 2 diabetes may be asymptomatic initially. Treatment typically follows a multi-faceted approach: (1) Lifestyle modifications including a balanced diet low in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats, regular physical activity (150 minutes per week recommended), and weight loss if overweight; (2) Oral medications such as metformin (first-line), sulfonylureas, DPP-4 inhibitors, or SGLT2 inhibitors depending on individual factors; (3) Injectable medications including GLP-1 receptor agonists or insulin if oral medications are insufficient; and (4) Regular monitoring of blood glucose levels and HbA1c testing. Treatment plans should be individualized based on patient age, comorbidities, and risk factors. Patients should work closely with their healthcare team including endocrinologists, dietitians, and diabetes educators. It's important to note this information is for educational purposes only and individuals should consult their healthcare provider for personalized medical advice.

**Q:** What is the difference between bacterial and viral infections?

**A:** Bacterial and viral infections differ fundamentally in their causative organisms and treatment approaches. Bacterial infections are caused by single-celled microorganisms (bacteria) that can live independently and reproduce by binary fission. Common examples include strep throat, urinary tract infections, and bacterial pneumonia. Viral infections are caused by viruses - much smaller infectious agents that require host cells to replicate. Examples include the common cold, influenza, and COVID-19. Key differences include: (1) Size - viruses are typically 100 times smaller than bacteria; (2) Treatment - bacterial infections respond to antibiotics, while viral infections generally do not and are treated supportively or with specific antiviral medications; (3) Reproduction - bacteria reproduce independently, viruses need host cells; (4) Structure - bacteria have cell walls, viruses have protein coats. Clinically, distinguishing between them is important for appropriate treatment, as unnecessary antibiotic use contributes to antibiotic resistance. Diagnostic tests such as cultures, rapid antigen tests, or PCR may help differentiate. Symptoms alone often cannot reliably distinguish bacterial from viral infections, requiring clinical judgment and sometimes laboratory testing.
