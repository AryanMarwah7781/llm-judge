1. Question: What is the standard for summary judgment under Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure?
   Answer: Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56, summary judgment is appropriate when "the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law." The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact. The court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in their favor. A fact is "material" if it might affect the outcome under governing law, and a dispute is "genuine" if a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the non-moving party. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317 (1986); Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242 (1986).

2. Question: What are the Daubert factors for admissibility of expert testimony?
   Answer: Under Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993), and codified in Fed. R. Evid. 702, courts act as gatekeepers to ensure expert testimony is both relevant and reliable. The factors for assessing reliability include: (1) whether the theory or technique can be and has been tested; (2) whether it has been subject to peer review and publication; (3) the known or potential rate of error; (4) the existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation; and (5) whether it has gained general acceptance in the relevant scientific community. These factors are flexible and not exhaustive; the inquiry is tailored to the specific facts of each case.

3. Question: What is the state action doctrine under the Fourteenth Amendment?
   Answer: The state action doctrine requires that constitutional violations, particularly under the Fourteenth Amendment, must involve action by a governmental entity or official. Private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful, does not violate the Constitution unless it can be fairly attributable to the state. State action may be found when: (1) the state exercises coercive power or provides significant encouragement; (2) a private entity performs a function traditionally exclusively reserved to the state; or (3) the state and private party are so entwined that the private party's actions constitute state action. The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3 (1883); Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922 (1982).

4. Question: What is the plain view doctrine?
   Answer: The plain view doctrine is an exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement, allowing officers to seize evidence without a warrant if three conditions are met: (1) the officer is lawfully in a position from which the object can be plainly viewed; (2) the officer has lawful right of access to the object itself; and (3) the incriminating nature of the object is immediately apparent (i.e., the officer has probable cause to believe the item is contraband or evidence). Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990). The doctrine recognizes that if contraband is left in plain view and discovered during a lawful observation, no invasion of privacy occurs by its seizure.

5. Question: What is the business judgment rule?
   Answer: The business judgment rule is a presumption that corporate directors, in making business decisions, acted on an informed basis, in good faith, and in the honest belief that the action was in the best interests of the company. Under this rule, courts will not second-guess directors' business decisions or hold them liable for losses resulting from those decisions if they were made in good faith and with due care. To invoke the rule's protection, directors must show they acted (1) with due care (informed decision), (2) in good faith, and (3) in the honest belief that the action serves the corporation's best interests. Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805 (Del. 1984). The rule does not protect decisions tainted by fraud, illegality, or self-dealing.
